"""RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS).

Implemented from the RFC text. JCS is the canonical form for the AITP
JCS-embedded-signature profile (envelopes, Manifests, revocation snapshots,
handshake payloads — RFC-AITP-0001 §5.4.1): compact JSON, no whitespace,
object member names sorted by UTF-16 code unit, ECMAScript ``Number::toString``
number formatting, minimal string escaping.

Number handling follows RFC 8785 §3.2.2.3 (which defers to ECMA-262). AITP
signed bodies use only integer numbers (unix seconds, sizes), so the float
path is implemented for completeness and validated against the pinned
``known-answer/jcs-sha256.json`` manifest vector; it reuses CPython's
shortest-round-trip ``repr`` digits and applies the ECMA formatting bands.

The serializer is depth-capped (``_MAX_DEPTH``): it refuses to descend past a
fixed nesting depth and raises ``JcsError``, so attacker-supplied nesting --
which can sit anywhere inside an ``extensions`` member whose interior
RFC-AITP-0001 §7 forbids inspecting -- becomes an ordinary structural
rejection instead of a raw ``RecursionError`` escaping the verifier. It is
also node-visit-capped (``_MAX_NODES_VISITED``, issue #54): depth alone does
not bound total work for an *aliased* Python value -- the same dict/list
object referenced more than once inside its own containing structure,
unreachable via JSON but reachable from a direct Python caller -- since
``_serialize`` recurses into both dicts and lists and allocates output per
node, so aliasing there costs real, non-deduplicated memory on top of CPU
time.

# Maximum *relative* nesting depth of a single canonicalization walk -- not a
# bound on total document size, which is an orthogonal concern already bounded
# by input size (JCS output is linear in input, and this library parses nothing
# itself: every entry point receives an already-parsed value). Chosen against
# three measured bounds:
#   1. real AITP artifacts nest ~3-5 levels (deepest shapes in the conformance
#      pack: `session_bundle.session_bundle.participants[i]` and
#      `issuer_revocation_list.snapshot.revocation_list.entries[i]`), so 256 is
#      ~50x any legitimate document;
#   2. the interpreter's own ceiling from these call sites is ~993-1200 frames
#      (measured on CPython 3.13 at the stock limit of 1000);
#   3. the cap must leave generous headroom for the *embedding caller's* stack,
#      which is unmeasurable from inside this library -- 256 leaves it ~730 of
#      the interpreter's frame budget.
# Deliberately a fixed constant rather than something derived from
# `sys.getrecursionlimit()` at import time: the rejection must be reproducible
# across interpreters and across a caller that changes the limit, which is what
# makes it testable at all.
_MAX_DEPTH = 256

# Maximum number of _serialize calls ("nodes") a single dumps/canonicalize
# call will make, checked at entry -- before the existing depth check, same
# "guard at entry, not at the two recursion sites" placement _MAX_DEPTH's own
# check already uses. _MAX_DEPTH bounds nesting *depth* only: it does nothing
# for a candidate-free-analogue value (a long flat list of scalars, no
# nesting at all) and, worse, for an *aliased* Python value -- the same
# dict/list object referenced more than once inside its own containing
# structure, unreachable via JSON (which never aliases), reachable only from
# a direct Python caller constructing the value in-process -- the walk is not
# merely unbounded but exponential, the same primitive issue #49 closed for
# jwk.py's list-only walk. Unlike jwk.py, this walk recurses into BOTH dicts
# and lists (jwk.py's dict branch is always a terminal leaf), so the aliasing
# primitive is reachable through either container type here, and this walk
# allocates real output per node (`out.append`), not merely CPU time.
#
# Bounding total node visits also bounds total output size, but as a BOUNDED
# multiplier over the attacker's own real allocated memory, not literally as
# a fixed O(1)-per-visit constant: a revisited dict of width `w` re-sorts its
# keys on every visit (`sorted(value.keys(), ...)` below), costing
# `O(w log w)`, not `O(1)`, per revisit -- negligible at this cap
# (`log(200000) ~= 18`) but worth stating precisely rather than overclaiming
# "fixed." A single non-aliased, oversized leaf (one huge string/number) is
# explicitly out of scope: its own formatting cost is proportional to that
# value's own already-allocated size, the same "document size is bounded by
# input size" cost this module already treats as expected and orthogonal to
# aliasing (see the module docstring) -- this cap bounds the DISPROPORTION
# aliasing introduces, not raw non-aliased document size.
#
# 200000 is generous, not tightly calibrated: no schema-level cap exists on
# array length anywhere this module's callers construct values from
# (revocation entries, manifest files, session participants -- checked; none
# found), nor in the sibling spec repo's own schemas, so there is no real
# observed maximum to calibrate against -- same epistemic status jwk.py's own
# "generous, not tight" constants have. At the cap, measured worst-case cost
# (list-aliased: 56ms CPU / 391KB output; dict-aliased: 132ms / ~1.37MB; flat
# non-aliased width-200000 dict: 192ms / ~3.18MB) is negligible either way for
# a synchronous per-call verification path, while remaining 3-4 orders of
# magnitude over any realistic AITP document (which nests only 3-5 levels
# per _MAX_DEPTH's own reasoning above).
